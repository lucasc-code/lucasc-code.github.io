		<p>This is a space for ideas.</p>
		<p>I'll share what I find interesting and useful.</p>


		<h2>Content Before Design</h2>
		<p>As I build out this website, I'm noticing that I'd prefer to create more content to fill it out before putting more effort into design.</p>
		<p>Design, for me, works best with creative constraints. And without content, there are very few constraints.</p>

		<h2>NFT Experiments</h2>
		<p>In order to get a more experiential understanding of the NFT space (aside from just browsing Twitter) I decided to create a couple of my own.</p>
		<p>To reference John Vervaeke's work, I had a good sense of <em>propositional</em> knowledge (the language used in the space) but not yet <em>procedural</em> (how to create my own) or <em>perspectival</em> (what it feels like to create my own) knowledge.</p>
		<p>So I messed around in Keynote and created two images, which I then minted on OpenSea as NFTs.</p>
		<p>After designing the images, the minting process was surprisingly easy to do. It felt like uploading an image to any other platform on the web, except I had to connect my Metamask wallet first. I was expecting some cool whiz-bang technical process to happen, to see the blockchain in action, but... nope! I just clicked the mint button, gave it a title and there it was.</p>
		<p>Here are the two NFTs I created. One was minted via Polygon (free to move around) and the other was minted via the Ethereum network (free to mint one copy, but costs gas to move around).</p>

		<p>If you click them, you'll see the Opensea listing pop up.</p>
		<p>I'm sure in a 5-10 years from now this process will become so normal that a blog post about creating one would be silly.</p>
		<p>It might not be Opensea, it might not be Polygon and it might not even be Ethereum that's used, but I can't imagine NFTs not playing a significant role in how most people interact online in the future.</p>

		<h2>Side Projects</h2>
		<p>Side projects. Doing things outside one’s normal set of tasks and responsibilities for the sake of curiosity, learning or contribution.</p>
		<p>They’re famously known for the beginnings of a major transition in someone’s life. A side project led to a change in careers, new relationships, even starting a successful company…</p>
		<p>It’s taken me quite a while to start a side project of my own.</p>	
		<p>Part of that is because my job takes a lot of time. And it often takes me down rabbit holes of learning and creation that in a way, feel similar to side projects.</p> 
		<p>Another part is that I consume so much content from others in my spare time. The bar for what my own side project should be becomes unreachable. My info-sphere is surrounded by listening, reading, watching (and interacting with) people at the top of their domains. That can make starting my own thing feel miles off from those I admire.</p>
		<p>And lastly, it’s because I haven’t thought up one that I’ve actually wanted to do. Sure, I’ll read books and articles in new domains I’m unfamiliar with… or sometimes try to learn on new skills (ex. javascript or solidity) but when it comes to starting a project around those things, I tend to fall flat on ideas.</p>
		<p>And yet, here we are! For some reason, creating a personal website/blog is the side project I’ve taken up (with enjoyment).</p>
		<p>Let’s see where this goes.</p>
