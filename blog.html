		<h2>Side Projects</h2>
		<p>Side projects. Doing things outside one’s normal set of tasks and responsibilities for the sake of curiosity, learning or contribution.</p>
		<p>They’re famously known for the beginnings of a major transition in someone’s life. A side project led to a change in careers, new relationships, even starting a successful company…</p>
		<p>It’s taken me quite a while to start a side project of my own.</p>	
		<p>Part of that is because my job takes a lot of time. And it often takes me down rabbit holes of learning and creation that in a way, feel similar to side projects.</p> 
		<p>Another part is that I consume so much content from others in my spare time. The bar for what my own side project should be becomes unreachable. My info-sphere is surrounded by listening, reading, watching (and interacting with) people at the top of their domains. That can make starting my own thing feel miles off from those I admire.</p>
		<p>And lastly, it’s because I haven’t thought up one that I’ve actually wanted to do. Sure, I’ll read books and articles in new domains I’m unfamiliar with… or sometimes try to learn on new skills (ex. javascript or solidity) but when it comes to starting a project around those things, I tend to fall flat on ideas.</p>
		<p>And yet, here we are! For some reason, creating a personal website/blog is the side project I’ve taken up (with enjoyment).</p>
		<p>Let’s see where this goes.</p>
