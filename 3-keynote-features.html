		<h2>3 Little-Known Keynote Design Features I Use All the Time
		</h2>
		I’ve been using Apple Keynote for design for the past 10 years or so, and it’s held up surprisingly well. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The creative constraints of the platform helped me get pretty good at testing its limits. 
		<br>
		<br>
		So, here are a few design features that took me a while to discover, which I now use all the time:
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210063"><strong>Image-Fill for Text</strong></a>. This is a great way to enhance the quality of text and make it stand out. Gradient fill for text is similar.</li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keynote/draw-a-shape-tana1f067dfc/mac"><strong>The Pen Tool</strong></a>. A helpful way to make custom shapes. I often use this for cropping out irregular sections of images.</li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/pages/copy-and-paste-text-styles-tan0d051d6af/mac"><strong>Copy/Paste Style</strong></a>. The keyboard shortcut for this is “Option Command C” (⌥ ⌘ C) to Copy or “Option Command V” (⌥ ⌘ V) to Paste. Very helpful for matching styles while designing.</li>
		</ol>
		And that’s it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I initially thought this post was going to be longer but that’s the thing about Keynote. 
		<br>
		<br>
		A lot of the design features are fairly basic, so those are three easily overlooked but incredibly valuable tools.
