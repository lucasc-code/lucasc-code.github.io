		<p>For the past 5 years I've been working at <a href="https://www.flowgenomeproject.com">Flow Genome Project</a>, scaling our operations and digital marketing.</p>
		<p>Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://www.axonify.com">Axonify</a> as a Customer Success Associate, and <a href="http://optimoz.com.au/">Optimoz</a>, as a Digital Marketing Associate.</p>
		<p>I also led the Canadian chapter of <a href="https://www.kairoshq.com">Kairos Society</a> (a global network of young entrpreneurs in healthcare, clean tech, and education) from 2016-2017.</p>
		<p>I'm interested in quite a lot. Currently, these three (and their intersection) stand out: programming, design, and writing.</p>
