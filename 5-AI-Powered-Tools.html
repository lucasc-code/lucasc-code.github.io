	<br>
	AI tools are becoming so prevalent that I’m now coming back to them on a daily basis.
	<br><br>
	Based on the rate of change in this space, I assume these will change or update quickly. But for now, here are some of my favorites and go-tos:
	<br><br>
	<h3>1. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL·E 2</a></h3>
	<em>AI Text-to-Image Generation</em>
	<br><br>
	<strong>What is it?</strong> DALL·E is a text-to-image generation tool that creates beautiful art from simple word and phrase prompts.
	<br><br>
	<strong>How am I using it?</strong> Generating article header images and unique slides for work presentations. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>Example:</strong> From the following prompt, “the similarity between the shape of human lungs and the shape of tree branches, digital art,” I was able to create these images:
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	<h3>2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://summarize.tech">Summarize.tech</a></h3>
	<em>AI Powered Video Summaries</em>
	<br><br>
	<strong>What is it?</strong> This web app creates bullet-point summaries of YouTube videos. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>How am I using it?</strong> I’ve been using it to review work meetings and presentations to get a quick sense of what was discussed. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>Example:</strong> I summarized a keynote presentation to discern what short-form marketing videos could come from it.
	<br><br><br>

	H/t to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/lyskovandrei">@LyskovAndrei</a> for sharing this one with me!
	<br><br>
	<h3>3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://replicate.com/nightmareai/real-esrgan">Image Quality Enhancer</a></h3>
	<em>AI Image Enhancement</em>
	<br><br>
	<strong>What is it?</strong> A simple application that lets you upload an image and generate a higher quality version of it.
	<br><br>
	<strong>How am I using it?</strong> For an amazon business, I uploaded a previously pixelated product listing image and ran it through this app to enhance it.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Example:</strong>
	<br><br>
	<img src="Images/GRT Image Enhance Before:After.jpeg" alt="GRT Before and After Image Enhancer" class="image2">
	<br><br>
	(Note: We did also edit the lighting manually after using the AI tool, but you can still see a noticeable difference in the quality of the image, especially the tattoo product itself)
	<br><br>
	<h3>4. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://beta.openai.com/playground">OpenAI's Playground</a></h3>
	<em>AI Text Generation</em>
	<br><br>
	<strong>What is it?</strong> This is effectively a sandbox for Open AI’s text generation model via GPT-3. You type in any prompt or request, and GPT-3 will generate text that completes it, matching the context of what you wrote.
	<br><br>
	<strong>How am I using it?</strong> Article structure ideas, startup ideas, tweet structure ideas. Effectively overcoming writer’s block by adding scaffolding to potential content. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>Example:</strong> When thinking about the structure for this post, I asked GPT-3 in the Playground app, and here’s what it said (highlighted in green):
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	<h3>5. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://avatarai.me/">Avatar AI</a></h3>
	<em>AI Generated Personal Avatars</em>
	<br><br>
	<strong>What is it?</strong> This app generates hundreds of animated-style and photo realistic avatars of yourself in different situations.
	<br><br>
	<strong>How am I using it?</strong> Most recently, my wife and I used it to generate photos of her wearing her temporary face tattoo designs to see what the AI model would create. Not only did it create incredibly unique avatar generations of her, but it also made <em>new variations of her tattoo designs</em>, sparking a bunch of new product ideas.
	<br><br>
	(This one I’ll hold on sharing the photo until she creates the new product, but it’s awesome!)
	<br><br><br>
	––––––––––
	<br><br>
	<h3>So what’s next for marketers and designers?</h3>
	I think AI-powered tools will become a regular part of day-to-day workflows in the coming months and years. 
	<br><br>
	I consistently find myself saving time and generating new ideas from them (and the new ones are super fun to experiment with). 
	<br><br>
	So check them out, try them for yourself, and let me know if you find others that you come back to regularly!
