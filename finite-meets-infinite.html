		To paraphrase Forrest Landry, expressions have an instructive dynamic. We put thoughts into structure or form.
		<br><br>
		That’s why the subjective is so much harder to label. It’s not meant to be defined. Its nature is fluidity. 
		<br><br>
		The world has hard lines and edges. Boundaries and contrast. 
		<br><br>
		The mind has no lines nor edges. No limits. Openings and context. 
		<br><br>
		Both are needed for the human experience. The subjective and the objective. The dynamic between the two is at the core of conscious experience.
		<br><br>
		Some people discount the objective. Idealism, as Forrest calls it. Placing too much significance on the internal world, and even assuming that’s all that exists.
		<br><br>
		Others discount the subjective. Realism. Only seeing the clear definitions of the physical world, forgetting the meaning and significance inherent in our subjective experiences.
		<br><br>
		To live fully is to acknowledge and accept both. Know that life is not a binary, one or the other choice. It’s our relationship between the two. <em>Our</em> world and <em>the</em> world. There are infinite subjective worlds, and there’s only one objective world (that we know of).
		<br><br>
		Infinite subjectivity. Finite objectivity.
		<br><br>
		When the finite meets the infinite, life shows up.
