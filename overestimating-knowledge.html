		<h2>Overestimating Knowledge
		</h2>
		They say you don’t understand something until you try writing about it or explaining it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Why is that?
		<br>
		<br>
		Why do we assume we understand more than we do?
		<br>
		<br>
		At what point does information go from being completely unknown to prompting overconfidence?
		<br>
		<br>
		Let’s explore. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I think it’s because we associate familiarity with understanding.
		<br>
		<br>
		We assume that because we’ve heard an idea once, we get it. We know it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		But we often don’t know it at all. We just think we do. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s not until we start writing or talking that we realize how much we don’t know.
		<br>
		<br>
		And this makes sense, the more I think (and write) about it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When writing, we’re not just off the hook after a topic initially comes into our awareness. We can’t just stop at familiarity and move on.
		<br>
		<br>
		Instead, we’re on the hook to fill a blank page with lots of information about a subject.
		<br>
		<br>
		Or fill a conversational void (or period of silence) with useful discourse around it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		We must structure our thoughts to fill the space. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Which completely changes the standard for what it means to “know” something. Familiarity isn’t enough. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Maybe it’d be helpful to adjust our language. 
		<br>
		<br>
		We can speak in terms of:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>To know of (familiarity).</strong> <em>I’ve heard of the idea/subject and I’m aware that it exists.</em>
			</li>
			<li><strong>To write about (understanding).</strong> <em>I get it, so much so that I can write useful information about it.</em> 
			</li>
			<li><strong>To teach (understanding).</strong> <em>I get it, so much so that I can help other people understand it in real time.</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		And then, there’s no need to say that we “know” something.
		<br>
		<br>
		Instead, we can simply distinguish between familiarity and understanding. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Maybe then we’ll get a little closer to accurately representing how much (and how little) we actually know about the world.
