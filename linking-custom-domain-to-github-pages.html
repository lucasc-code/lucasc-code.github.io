		Here’s something I couldn’t find on the Github Docs guides. Their posts got me 90% of the way, so I’ll share the final 10% that I had to figure out separately.
		<br>
		<br>
		Steps to link a custom domain to your Github website:
		<ol>
			<li>Buy a domain (I used Godaddy).</li>
			<li>Create/code your website files and push them to your Github Repository. Here’s a <a href="https://medium.com/@svinkle/publish-and-share-your-own-website-for-free-with-github-2eff049a1cb5">great walkthrough post</a> to do so.</li>
			<li>On <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, log in and go to Settings > Pages > then add your domain to the “Custom Domain” input section, then save it. (This should create a CNAME record with your domain in it in your Github repository).</li>
			<li>On your DNS settings, change the CNAME from pointing towards yourdomain.com to your username.github.io domain.</li>
			<li>Add the four IP addresses as A records in your domain. You can find them in this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">Github Docs guide</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Delete the A record that points to “Parked” that was auto created upon buying the domain.</strong></li>
		</ol>
		I was able to find all this info online except Point #6.
		<br>
		<br>
		On Godaddy, the default A record includes one that just points to “Parked.” My site wasn’t working until I realized I had to deleted that A record, as it was interfering with the others.
		Figured I’d share it online in case anyone’s looking, as it took me a while to figure it out.
