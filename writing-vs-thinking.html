		<h2>Writing vs. Thinking
		</h2>
		The more I write, the more I notice how different it is from thinking. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Writing is directive and conclusive. Thoughts are open and expansive. 
		<br>
		<br>
		They both might start out exploratory. But while thoughts branch out expansively, writing grounds insights narrowly.
		<br>
		<br>
		By writing something, you're reducing the possibility space of where an idea can go. You're seeing thoughts through to conclusions.
		<br>

		<br>
		It’s hard to find time to write. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s also hard to find time to think. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s much harder to multitask when writing than it is to multitask when thinking. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Our fingers and keyboards provide liberating structures to guide the mind even when it doesn’t yet know its destination.
		<br>
		<br>
		That’s why meditation could be perceived as harder than writing. It’s just you and your thoughts, with few other structures at play. At least with writing it’s you, your fingers, a keyboard (or a pen) and your thoughts. Adding elements makes it easier to engage.
		<br>
		<br>
		You can also see the entire past history of your current writing session in real time as you write. Totally different from thinking––thoughts come and go. Words stay.
		<br>
		<br>
		Writing takes thoughts and instantiates them into the world. A bridge from the mind to reality. And one which benefits both.
