		<h2>Writing vs. Thinking
		</h2>
		The mind seems to produce words quite differently than thoughts. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Writing is more directive and conclusive, while thoughts are more open and expansive. 
		<br>
		<br>
		They both start out exploratory. But while thoughts branch out expansively, writing grounds insights narrowly.
		<br>
		<br>
		By writing something, you're reducing the possibility space of where an idea can go. You're seeing thoughts through to conclusions.
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s hard to find time to write. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s also hard to find time to think. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Many of us have our thinking done for us. With constant media exposure, we can get by pretty far without much novelty in our own thoughts.
		<br>
		<br>
		But we don’t really have our writing done for us. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Thinking consists of:
		<ol>
			<li>Other people’s ideas (known or new)</li>
			<li>Your own ideas (known or new)</li>
		</ol>
		With writing, there’s less defaulting to other people’s ideas given that you’re writing with your own hand. So you’re unequivocally doing it yourself. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s much harder to multitask when writing than it is to multitask when thinking. Our fingers and keyboards provide liberating structures to guide the mind even when it doesn’t yet know its destination.
		<br>
		<br>
		That’s why meditation could be perceived as harder than writing. It’s just you and your thoughts, with few other structures at play. At least with writing it’s you, your fingers, a keyboard (or a pen) and your thoughts. Adding elements makes it easier to engage.
		<br>
		<br>
		You can also see the entire past history of your current writing session in real time as you write. Totally different from thinking––thoughts come and go. Words stay.
		<br>
		<br>
		Writing takes thoughts and instantiates them into the world. A bridge from the mind to reality. And one which benefits both.
		<br>
		<br>
		The mind benefits from clearer thinking. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Reality benefits from new ideas coming into the world.
		<br>
		<br>
		So if you’re looking to not just explore ideas, but come to new conclusions as well, try writing over just thinking.
