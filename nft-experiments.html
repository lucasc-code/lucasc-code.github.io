		<h2>NFT Experiments</h2>
		<p>In order to get a more experiential understanding of the NFT space (aside from just browsing Twitter) I decided to create a couple of my own.</p>
		<p>To reference John Vervaeke's work, I had a good sense of <em>propositional</em> knowledge (the language used in the space) but not yet <em>procedural</em> (how to create my own) or <em>perspectival</em> (what it feels like to create my own) knowledge.</p>
		<p>So I messed around in Keynote and created two images, which I then minted on OpenSea as NFTs.</p>
		<p>After designing the images, the minting process was surprisingly easy to do. It felt like uploading an image to any other platform on the web, except I had to connect my Metamask wallet first. I was expecting some cool whiz-bang technical process to happen, to see the blockchain in action, but... nope! I just clicked the mint button, gave it a title and there it was.</p>
		<p>Here are the two NFTs I created. One was minted via Polygon (free to move around) and the other was minted via the Ethereum network (free to mint one copy, but costs gas to move around).</p>

		<p>If you click them, you'll see the Opensea listing pop up.</p>
		<p>I'm sure in a 5-10 years from now this process will become so normal that a blog post about creating one would be silly.</p>
		<p>It might not be Opensea, it might not be Polygon and it might not even be Ethereum that's used, but I can't imagine NFTs not playing a significant role in how most people interact online in the future.</p>
